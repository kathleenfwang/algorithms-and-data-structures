// nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2], return [-1, 3, -1] because no element in nums2 is greater than 4, 3 is the first number in nums2 greater than 1, and no element in nums2 is greater than 2.
// nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4], return [3, -1] because 3 is the first greater element that occurs in nums2 after 2 and no element is greater than 4.
